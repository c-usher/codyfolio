        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer living in Colorado. I have a passion for
          developing applications that will help people in their daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graduating General Assembly has motivated me to follow my dream and
          become a Software Engineer full-time. I have experience with AWS as
          well as MERN stack applications. I am also familiar with PostgresSQL
          and other database management tools. I am a quick learner and a hard
          worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to stay busy and practice my craft by always having an
          application or game I am working on. For an example of my work, please
          take a look at my portfolio section.
